## Details


<a name="fwdsecracy"></a>

### ForwardSecrecy
    * bit 0 (1) - set if at least one browser from our simulations negotiated a Forward Secrecy suite.
    * bit 1 (2) - set based on Simulator results if FS is achieved with modern clients. For example, the server supports ECDHE suites, but not DHE.
    * bit 2 (4) - set if all simulated clients achieve FS. In other words, this requires an ECDHE + DHE combination to be supported.

    
<a name="reneg"></a>

### RenegSupport
    * bit 0 (1) - set if insecure client-initiated renegotiation is supported
    * bit 1 (2) - set if secure renegotiation is supported
    * bit 2 (4) - set if secure client-initiated renegotiation is supported
    * bit 3 (8) - set if the server requires secure renegotiation support

### OpenSSLCCS
   * -1 - test failed
   * 0 - unknown
   * 1 - not vulnerable
   * 2 - possibly vulnerable, but not exploitable
   * 3 - vulnerable and exploitable

<a name="lucky"></a>

### OpenSSLLuckyMinus20
    * -1 - test failed
    * 0 - unknown
    * 1 - not vulnerable
    * 2 - vulnerable and insecure

<a name="ticketbleed"></a>

### Ticketbleed
   * -1 - test failed
   * 0 - unknown
   * 1 - not vulnerable
   * 2 - vulnerable and insecure

<a name="robot"></a>

### Bleichenbacher
   * -1 - test failed
   * 0 - unknown
   * 1 - not vulnerable
   * 2 - vulnerable (weak oracle)
   * 3 - vulnerable (strong oracle)
   * 4 - inconsistent results

<a name="poodle"></a>

### Poodle
   * -3 - timeout
   * -2 - TLS not supported
   * -1 - test failed
   * 0 - unknown
   * 1 - not vulnerable
   * 2 - vulnerable

<a name="known"></a>

### Known Debian Insecure
  * 0 - no
  * 1 - yes, but they're not weak
  * 2 - yes and they're weak

<a name="chain"></a>

### Certificate Chain Issues
   * bit 0 (1) - unused
   * bit 1 (2) - incomplete chain (set only when we were able to build a chain by adding missing intermediate certificates from external sources)
   * bit 2 (4) - chain contains unrelated or duplicate certificates (i.e., certificates that are not part of the same chain)
   * bit 3 (8) - the certificates form a chain (trusted or not), but the order is incorrect
   * bit 4 (16) - contains a self-signed root certificate (not set for self-signed leafs)
   * bit 5 (32) - the certificates form a chain (if we added external certificates, bit 1 will be set), but we could not validate it. If the leaf was trusted, that means that we built a different chain we trusted.

<a name="revoc"></a>

### Certificate Revocation Status
   * 0 - not checked
   * 1 - certificate revoked
   * 2 - certificate not revoked
   * 3 - revocation check error
   * 4 - no revocation information
   * 5 - internal error

<a name="CertIssue"></a>

### Certificate Issues
   * bit 0 (1) - no chain of trust
   * bit 1 (2) - not before
   * bit 2 (4) - not after
   * bit 3 (8) - hostname mismatch
   * bit 4 (16) - revoked
   * bit 5 (32) - bad common name
   * bit 6 (64) - self-signed
   * bit 7 (128) - blacklisted
   * bit 8 (256) - insecure signature
   * bit 9 (512) - insecure key
