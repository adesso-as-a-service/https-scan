Redirection-Crawler
============

The redirection crawler follows all the redirects of a domain, while saving
the corresponding domains and their returned status code.
If the status code is >= 500 the crwaler tries 2 more times to get a status
code under 500. If there is a request with a statuscode under 500 the data
will taken. If the webserver send all 3 times a status code >= 500 the data
from the last request will taken.
